Absci has two core lines of business

Cell Line Development

Drug Discovery

Absci is discovering new therapeutic monoclonal antibodies for oncology and infectious disease applications using a combination of screening RNA from human tissue (mostly cancer cells) and novel in-silico methodology. The goal is to discover antibodies, optimize their production through Absci’s cell line development process, and ultimately license the antibody producing cell line to a pharmaceutical or biotherapeutic manufacturing company.

Absci’s “stains” are a combination of the SoluPro cell line and plasmid(s) containing the DNA coding for our target protein and any required chaperons proteins.

Absci’s “goal” is togather enough data to submit our monoclonal antibodies to the FDA for Investigational New Drug status.

Absci’s ultimate product is an IND quality antibody based drug candidate and a manufacturing cell that we can then deliver to our clients/partners who will do large scale manufacturing and clinical trials.

Project Naming Conventions

Internal projects are labeled with mountain names.

Cell line development projects are labeled with dog names

Drug Discovery projects are labeled with bird names.

Partner projects are labeled with flower names and can be shared across both lines of business.

Current Driving AI programs

Lead Optimization - Project GLACIER: NLP-based in silico affinity maturation applications

Lead Optimization: In silico selection of amino acid identities within an existing CDS to increase antibody affinity; AI-assisted affinity maturation platform development to enabled drug discovery for partner and internal assets using in-silico approach

Glacier - therapeutic lead optimization; create monoclonal antibodies with higher antigen binding infinity; NLP-based in silico affinity maturation applications

Continuation of Trastuzumab in silico affinity maturation work: exploring model performance with an increase in mutational space + expansion of mutations into CDRH2 (draft manuscript complete by end of Q1)

VHH affinity maturation model: demonstrate that the approach works with in-house generated VHH data (BD case study complete by end of Q1)

Design of pH-sensitive binders: Finding an antibody that binds at higher affinity at pH 6.2 vs pH 7.4 (useful for increasing specificity for target in acidic tumor microenvironment) (model constructed Q2)

Human/Cyno target binding: Demonstrate ability to engineer antibodies to be cross-reactive to both human target and their animal orthologs (model constructed Q2, stretch goal - Q1)

Definition

Monoclonal Antibody

A type of protein that is made in the laboratory and can bind to certain targets in the body, such as antigens on the surface of cancer cells.

Non Standard Amino Acid

Amino acids that have been chemically modified after they have been incorporated into a protein, and those amino acids that occur in living organisms but are not found in proteins.

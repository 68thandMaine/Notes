## Empathizing With Users and Defining Pain Points

Empathy is the ability to understand someone else's feelings or thoughts in a situation.

Unlike pity or sympathy, empathy is considering and sharing the mental and emotional experience of someone. This is an important to distinguish because UX design is is not about solving problems we assume users want solved - it’s about solving problems users actually want solved. Thi
s is why it’s so important to conduct research before starting a design! By empathizing with a user, we are able to experience the product in the same way a user would, and the better we understand a users needs, the more comfortable the user will be with the design.

Here are six steps we can use to design with empathy

1. Ask lots of questions. As a UX designer, you cannot make assumptions about the needs of your users. Instead, ask your users directly about their needs and wants, which your product design can address. Ask questions that begin with what, how, and why to gain a deeper understanding of your users’ perspective.

2. Become more observant. Shift your focus to the whole user and not just the words they are using. In interviews where the user is physically present or on a video recording, watching a user interact with you or your product can provide physical cues that can affect your research outcomes. To help capture observations, you’ll take detailed notes or even record your sessions with users.

3. Be an active listener. Active listening requires you to fully concentrate on, understand, and remember what is being said by the user you’re interacting with. Avoid getting distracted by where the conversation is going or what you might say next. In UX design, practicing active listening can help you get impartial feedback directly from your users, which you can apply to improve your designs.

4. Request input. It’s important that the feedback you receive is objective and unbiased. Friends or colleagues often provide biased, mostly positive feedback because they want to support or please you. So, it’s important to request input from a variety of sources and a diverse group of users. When asking for feedback, use open-ended questions to understand the user’s actual thoughts on the experience or product.

5. Have an open mind. We all have biases. Remember, a bias is favoring or having prejudice against something or someone, based on limited information. As UX designers, we have to set those biases aside to better empathize with others. Your goal is to understand users, not to complicate their feedback with your own opinions and emotions.

6. Keep current on UX research. Follow researchers and join online communities to stay up-to-date on the research that affects UX designers and the users you’re designing for. Research is always changing and evolving as we understand more about human psychology. Staying current will give you an advantage in how you understand and interact with your audience.

### Recruiting Interview Participants

On way to start is with a screener survey. These are typically a short, detailed list of questions which determine if potential participants meet the requirements of a given study. Regardless, the most important step of this process is to determine the interview goals. Ask questions like:

- What do you want to learn from an interview?
- Are there certain user problems or pain points that you need to empathize with?
- Are there any characteristics of users you want to interview?

Why?

How much information should we have to ensure we get a comprehensive and balanced set of data?

During the process of conducting interviews, try to form a representative sample - or a subset of the population that seeks to accurately reflect the characteristics of a larger group. Make sure your representative sample is diverse in as many areas as possible.

### Empathy Maps

Empathy mapping article

Empathy maps are charts that explain everything that has been learned about a user after conducting interviews. They consist of four squares which show what the users says, does, thinks, and feels. There are two types of empathy maps: one user empathy maps, and aggregated (or multiple-user) empathy maps.

One user empathy maps are meant to be used to document feedback from a single user whereas aggregated empathy maps represent a visualization of everything a designers know about an entire user segment or group of similar users. Both maps contain the following sections:

#### Says Section

Try to use direct quotes in this section

#### Does Section

Actions or behaviors the user shares in the interview

#### Thinks Section

Use this section to include things the user doesn’t actually say, but that you can tell through observations. For example - facial expressions.

#### Feels Section

Documents how a user feels about something in the interview.

### Empathy map

Step 1: Add the user’s name. Include the name of the person interviewed in your empathy map. Having a name attached to it will help if you ever need to look back at the original transcript or research, and it’ll distinguish this map from other maps you create.

Step 2: The “SAYS” square. Use verbatim quotes from the interview. In other words, write down exactly what the person said; don’t summarize it in your own words. If you summarize a quote, you might accidentally interpret the user’s meaning incorrectly. It’s also helpful to try to capture themes in the interview that relate to the product you’re researching. For example, if the user restates the same problem several times during the interview, then it’s probably a major pain point. Pay special attention to challenges your user states, and record any desired benefits or expectations they mention.

Step 3: The “THINKS” square. Here, you can summarize the thoughts expressed by the user. Add feelings the user conveyed through body language, tone, or other noticeable indicators, even if they didn’t verbally express them to you. You can make inferences for some of these feelings, but you have to be careful not to make assumptions about the user.

Step 4: The “DOES” square. All the actions a user takes to overcome a present challenge go in the “DOES” square.

Step 5: The “FEELS” square. List the feelings the user expresses. The notes you include may overlap with some of what you listed in the “THINKS” square. That’s okay! This process is meant to be a thorough documentation of your observations. If you’re the person performing the interview, you might notice signs of feelings like anger, frustration, excitement, and others. If the user doesn’t explicitly mention any feelings during the interview, you can probe for feelings with the question: “How does this make you feel?”

Identify User Pain Point

Pain points are any UX issues that frustrate the user and block the user from getting what they need. Most pain points fall into one of four categories:

Financial pain points are user problems related to money. If you've ever gotten lost in an online article, only to be rudely interrupted by a paywall, you know all about these.

Product pain points are usually quality issues related to the product. The product should be intuitive and do what it says it does.

Process pain points are frustrations that stop the user going from point A to point B.

Support pain points occur when users interact with your product, have questions or suggestions, and cannot easily find answers or get support.

Pain points and solutions often seem closely related, but pain points do not offer a solution to the challenge:

## User Personas

In UX design, personas are fictional users whose goals and characteristics represent the needs of a larger group of users. While personas are fictional, the characters are based off of the user research that has been previously conducted. Personas are used to identify patterns of behavior in users which point to common paint points. After aggregating interview and pain points, a user group emerges which shares commonalities. From here, we can build personas.

Get creative: here is the example from the course:

> Meet Tsering Choedon, founder of afd. As we build the persona, we want to include her photo and a short biographical sketch. Include things like age, occupation, hometown, marital status, and any other demographic data points that might give us a better sense of who our user group is. So imagine that Tsering is 35, has a BA in English, and lives in Bellevue, Nebraska with her wife and two rescue dogs. After the biosketch comes a bit about her professional goals and day-to-day duties. As a founder of a nonprofit, Tsering probably fills lots of roles like writing grants and talking with city officials about exciting green initiatives. She also keeps residents informed about how and where to recycle their trash. After that, since you're designing an app, you might want to know how comfortable Tsering is at navigating online and working with tech. Let's say she's not so tech savvy, but knows she has to get her nonprofit online if she wants to find more volunteers. Finally, you might want to give her a catchphrase, something she says to inspire herself and her small team every day. For Tsering that might be something like gettin' greener every day. And just like that, your user group turns into a real person that the team can build their app around. Keep in mind each persona you create humanizes a user group for your team.

The big takeaway is that personas tell stories and are key to turning an average stakeholder presentation into a story telling experience. The build empathy and can put a face to the user and help stakeholders in the project understand who they are building for. It is beneficial to create multiple personas to create a diverse user group and ultimately a more robust and stress tested design.

Generally creating 3-8 personas is enough to represent the majority of a product’s user base.

Crafting User Stories

User stories are fictional, one sentence stories that connect the needs of a potential user to a specific action and benefit. These stories are told from a persona’s point of view and are meant to expand on the persona and deepen your knowledge of a user group. One of the main benefits of user stories is that there are a lot of requirements to consider, user stories, determine which ones are the most critical to resolve.

When writing user stories, we identify a user, a goal, and a conflict that prevents them from reaching the goal. The formula for writing user stories is this:

As a user, I want to action, so that benefit

User is who the app is being designed for.

Action describes what the user hopes will happen.

Benefit is why the user wants the action to happen.

The best practice for user stories is to keep them short, impactful, and to the point, with a clear action and benefit. Different users have different needs, so be sure to practice empathy and keep their unique needs in mind when writing user stories. To help you write the most effective user stories, check out this article from Interaction Design Foundation about how to write user stories.

### User Journeys

A user journey is the series of experiences a user has as they achieve a specific goal which are built off of the personas and user stories previously collected. Before starting to create a user journey, it’s beneficial to create a journey map.

Journey maps are used to create an illustration of the user goes through to achieve their goals. If the persona is your character, the user story is your plot, and the journey map is your story outline. You can start making journey maps by using a table. The first row contains the various actions a user must take to reach their goal. Next, the individual steps that each action is comprised of is documented in next row. After that, consider the emotional journey a user will experience as they move from task to task. Finally, the final action is to identify improvement opportunities after reviewing the prior information.

Benefits of user journey mapping:

Helps UX designers create obstacle-free paths for users

Reduces impact of designer bias.

Highlights new painpoints

Identifies improvement opportunities.

Accessible Design

Creating personas, user stories, and user journeys help UX designers better understand the needs of a group of users. This makes it especially important to consider the user stories and journeys of someone with a disability. Accessibility is not just designing to include a group of users with varying abilities; instead, it extends to those who experience a permanent, temporary, or situation disability.

“ Designing with accessibility in mind means making sure, Betty, a user with only one arm; Angela, a user with a sprained wrist; and Juan, a user holding a colicky newborn, all have everything they need to stay happily on their user journeys. Betty's disability is permanent, Angela's is temporary, and Juan's is situational, but they all need to achieve their user goal with only one hand. ”

It will be impossible to accurately guess all the ways a user will experience a product, but here are a few things to consider:

Touch: How do we design for users who have the use of one arm?

See: How would you design for users who have limited vision, either permanently, temporarily, or situationally?

Hear: How would you design for users who have limited hearing, either permanently, temporarily, or situationally?

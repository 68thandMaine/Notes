# Problem Statements and Value Propositions

## Problem Statements

A problem statement is a clear description of the user's needs that should be addressed.
Problem statements align the team on which user problem to focus on, giving everyone a clear
goal. A strong problem statement is human-centered. It should be broad enough to allow for
some creative freedom, but narrow enough that it can actually be solved by a design solution.
Problem statements can be written using a simple formula:

- Start with the name of the user.
  Add a short description of the user's characteristics. Clearly describe the user's need and
  explain why the user has that need.
  - It starts with the name of the user, a short description of the user’s characteristics,
    a description of the user need, and an explanation of why the user has the need.

An effective problem statement tells you what the user really needs. Defining the goal clearly
and concisely gets everyone on the design team onboard and focused on the same thing.

Second, problem statements help us understand constraints.
We want to know what's keeping
users from satisfying their needs.

Third, problem statements help us define deliverables.
When we finally solve the problem,
what will we have to show for it?
It's helpful to know what our solution will produce.

Finally, problem statements help us create benchmarks for success.
How will we know when we succeed?
If your goal is to open a door, for example, you'll know you've succeeded when you can see
what's behind the door.

Most design problems will be more complicated than opening a door, but the benchmark for
success should be just as straightforward.

The most common framework used to create problem statements is the 5 Ws and H framework.
After you define the user’s pain points, you can answer who, what, when, where, why, and how
to solve the user’s problem.

- **Who** is experiencing the problem?

  - Knowing your users and their background is key to creating successful solutions for them.

- **What** are the pain points you’re trying to solve?

  - Determining a user’s pain points early allows you to answer the rest of these questions and clarify the context of the pain points.

- **Where** is the user when they’re using the product?

  - A user’s physical context matters to your design.

- **When** does the problem occur?
  -Maybe it’s right after the end of a long and tedious process, or maybe it’s something that happens daily. Knowing when the problem occurs can help you better empathize with the user’s feelings.

- **Why** is the problem important?

  - Knowing how this problem affects your user’s experience and life will help to
    clarify the potential consequences.

- **How** are users reaching their goals by using the product?
  - Understanding how users reach their goals allows you to map the user journey that they
    take through your product.

To design a solution that fits the needs of your users, you have to understand the problem
from their point of view.

Thinking through the 5 Ws and how forces you to write out who the user is and describe the
full context of the problem from the user’s perspective.

## Hypothesis Statements

A hypothesis statement writes out our best educated guess on what we think the solution to a
design problem might be.

Hypothesis statements don’t have a single standard formula to follow, but there are two common methods you can try using to write one.

First, you can use the if / then format to come up with a hypothesis statement. Here are examples of if/then hypothesis statements applied to the users of the dog walker app:

- If Arnold downloads the dog walker app, then they can utilize the “simplified” mode setting to view only the basic app functions.

- If Tobias signs up for the dog walker app, then they will quickly and easily pick a walker that fits their schedule.

Second, you can use the we believe format to come up with a hypothesis statement. Here are examples of we believe hypothesis statements applied to the dog walker app:

- We believe that a simplified mode of the dog walker app for Arnold will allow them to hire dog walkers efficiently.

- We believe that easy access to available dog walkers for Tobias will increase the amount of walks they choose for their pets.

If / then statements focus directly on the needs of users. On the other hand, we believe statements take the perspective of your team into account, while remaining empathetic to the needs of users.

## Value Propositions

A value proposition should explain how a product meets the needs of people who use it. It's
the reason why someone would want to use the product or service. Value propositions ensure that
users have a reason to use the product that you are creating, as opposed to any other product
currently available.

In general start by doing research to answer the following two questions:

- **What does your product do?** - Clearly explain the offering that your product provides users.
- **Why should a user care?** - Describe how your product addresses users’ pain points.

Begin by following these steps:

1. Create a list of the all the features and benefits the product / feature ought to have.
2. Explain the value of the product by assigning the listed features and benefits to categories that represent product values which are identified in user research.
   - Some features might not be needed if they do not fit a product value.
3. Connect the features and benefits to the needs of the users by using personas and pairing each persona with a value proposition that meets their biggest pain point.
4. The features that you connect to personas are the features that ought to be developed.

Another way to boost a value proposition is by looking at competitor reviews and finding pain points in low rated reviews.

# Ideation Phase

The ideation phase is where we transition from learning about users and the problem to
coming up with solutions.

Ideation can be defined as the process of generating a broad set of ideas on a given topic with
no attempt to judge or evaluate them.

One of the best things about ideation is the mentality that there are no bad ideas.

Brainstorms out loud and document every idea often on sticky notes or a white board.
The goal is quantity of ideas over quality, so share as many ideas as possible.
No evaluation is allowed at this stage. If you're brainstorming in a group, make sure you
gather a diverse team for different backgrounds and perspectives.

- **Sequence of steps for ideation**

  - Brainstorming out loud
  - documenting all ideas
  - focusing on quantity without allowing evaluation
  - gathering a diverse team
  - questioning the obvious
  - evaluating the ideas.

- **Evaluating Ideas**
  1. Is the idea feasible?
  - Is it technically possible to build?
  2. Is the idea desirable
  - Does it solve the user problem you're focusing on?
  3. Is your idea viable?
  - Is it financially beneficial for the business?

If an idea meets these three criteria, it might be a good option to move forward with.

Before you begin the design ideation process you'll want some of the documents produced earlier
in the research phase. These should cover the steps involved with design:

1. Empathize with the user

- Empathy maps
- Personas
- User stories
- User journey maps

2. Define the problem

- Problem statements

3. Set a limit to the amount of time to brainstorm
4. Brainstorm this stuff among others.
5. No idea is off the table.

Ideation is about coming up with a lot of ideas and recording - even obvious ones. Pushing
past the obvious ideas can help get us to more innovative ones. Generating a large list of
ideas will be narrowed down by various constraints.
You want to start with a long list of potential ideas, so that when constraints are introduced,
you still have solutions that could work. In addition, we need to come up with ideas that are
equitable. The first idea you come up with might be perfect for you as a user, but
when we're designing with equity in mind, we want to make sure that the design works for
everyone who will use the product.

We need to keep in mind the fundamentals of driving sales when designing.

## Competitive Audit

A competitive audit is an overview of your competitors' strengths and weaknesses.
This includes: Identifying your key competitors,
Reviewing the products that your competitors offer,
Understanding how your competitors position themselves in the market,
Examining what your competition does well and what they could do better,
And considering how your competitors talk about themselves.
So, who do you consider to be your competition?
To be thorough, you should include both direct and
indirect competitors in your audit.

Direct competitors have offerings, meaning products, services, or features that are similar to your proudct and focus on the same audience.

Indirect competitors have a similar set of offerings, but focus on a different audience than you, or have a different set of offereings and focus on the same audience as you.

One way to do this is by creating a competitor table
A typical competitor table contains the following:

- Competitor’s name
- Competitor’s URL
- The number of users/downloads — mainly to identify the effectiveness of the platform
- Number of years the platform or product has been in use (optional)
- The main features being offered by competitors
- Cost of service/product
- Additional notes
